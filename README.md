# dgFlex

This is a simple discontinuous Galerkin (DG) code that solves the fourth-order beam bending equation with an additional term that represents buoyancy forces.

An out-of-the box example on the Milne Ice Shelf, Elsmere Island, Arctic Canada is provided.

As it runs out of the box, the codes does not account for bending at the ice front, although this could easily be implemented.

The code uses FEniCS https://fenicsproject.org/
